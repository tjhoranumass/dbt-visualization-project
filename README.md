# DBT Visualization Project

This DBT project is designed to model and transform e-commerce sales data into useful business insights. The project includes raw data ingestion, staging models, and marts for reporting purposes. The transformed data is then used for visualization and analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

dbt_project.yml # Main DBT project configuration file models/ staging/ stg_sales.sql # Staging model for sales data stg_customers.sql # Staging model for customer data stg_products.sql # Staging model for product data marts/ sales_reporting/ orders_by_day.sql # Mart for orders aggregated by day customer_lifetime_value.sql # Mart for customer lifetime value product_performance.sql # Mart for product performance analysis monthly_revenue_orders.sql # Mart for monthly revenue and orders snapshots/ sales_snapshots.sql # Snapshot model for tracking changes in sales data macros/ audit_macros.sql # Custom macros for data quality checks seeds/ customer_dim.csv # Static seed data for customer dimension product_dim.csv # Static seed data for product dimension

## How to Run the Pipeline

To run the DBT pipeline, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up the Profile**:
    - Ensure that your DBT profile is correctly configured in the `profiles.yml` file. It should contain the correct credentials to connect to your PostgreSQL database.

2. **Run the Pipeline**:
    Use the following command to execute the pipeline and build all models:
    ```bash
    dbt run
    ```

    This command will run all transformations from the staging models to the marts.

3. **Test the Pipeline**:
    You can run tests to ensure the pipeline's integrity:
    ```bash
    dbt test
    ```

    This will run any `schema.yml` tests defined for your models, such as checking for uniqueness or null values.

4. **Snapshot Process**:
    If your project includes snapshots for tracking changes over time (like for sales data), run the following command:
    ```bash
    dbt snapshot
    ```

    Snapshots help you maintain historical records of your data by capturing the state of specific tables at each point in time.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you restart your DBT environment and refresh connections if you make significant changes to the database or models.
- You can customize the marts and staging models further to fit specific business requirements.
